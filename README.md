# ImageShop App

ImageShop is a React application that revolutionizes the way you shop. By simply taking a photo of an item you want to buy, ImageShop will use advanced vector search capabilities to recommend the closest match available in the store. 
This app is powered by Weaviate, a vector search database, for image-based search functionalities, and Firebase for managing user data and other simple data storage needs.

## Features

- **Photo Search**: Users can take photos of items and receive instant recommendations on similar products available in the store.
- **Interactive Shopfront**: Users can browse a regular shopfront with item images and generated data.
